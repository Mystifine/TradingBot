# TradingBot
This is a day trading bot designed with day trading parameters. Could be used for other forms of trading but it is not recommended as tests cases and simulations were done for day trading.

Ideal Day Trading Parameters:
5m Interval allows for better ATR measurements. 1m interval introduces too much noise and triggers too many trades.
2d Allows for recent data trends especially good for day trading since past data isn't as relevant. We are looking to read live trends.
